## Lightning Talk

**Some quick reminders:**

* 3-5 minutes
* Can be done with slides or no slides (we'd love to see you try!)
* You will have access to a projecter and/or a whiteboard
* if you need any props, please let us know!

### Plan

> What do you want  to have your lightning talk about? It can be about anything like art to why JSX is bad, as long it's appropriate.
> 
> My lightning talk will be giving driving tips and advice for teens to drive well on the roads and do well on the tests. As a fellow teenager who finally got their driver's license I'd like my talk to motivate other teens to get on their horse and work towards getting their driver's license if they've been holding it off for a while. I also feel like I've learned a lot from the tests and from driving on actual roads, given I failed both the written and driver's tests once (whoops). I'll use these experiences to show what I've learned and what not to do when driving and taking these tests to make the talk funny and engaging. But I believe this'll be an exciting topic for some, and a knowledgeable topic for others. 

> What would the talk look like? Mention if you're going to have slides!!

> Kinda explained it above, essentially talking about key driving tips for teens and how they can improve their driving based on a few tips + tricks. I haven't decided if I want slides, but I usually tend to use slides for short presentations to continuously gauge the audience's attention since I know a lot of people understand and comprehend info visually. 

Here's an example: 

* I want to talk about why tabs are better than spaces
* Show them the difference of tabs and spaces
* I'll give extreme and funny examples
* I will show code and use a clip from the internet
* I will have slides and need a projecter

.. and so forth (you can also write a full paragraph if you'd like).
