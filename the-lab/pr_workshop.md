## Workshop name

### Plan

> What do you want to run, and how do you think it'll be like? (can you give us a rough outline?)
> Building a Professional UI: essentially going from start to finish on tips and tricks for building a professional ui for short term goals like hackathons to long term goals such as building an app-based business. i'll be diving deep into these examples and how I've worked in hackathons teams where our UI managed to place us in top hackathons such as @ Stanford, and how I eventually used these skills to build my own card app that I published on the iOS app store, going from prototype -> execution.
>
> going from passion to project: showcasing how I, as a fellow bored high schooler, managed to find multiple CAD and 3d printing based companies from scratch all because of some projects that I wanted to take a step further. similar layout to the first workshop, where I would also present tips and tricks on how to go from square one to 100. could also give advice on pursuing mentorship and sponsorships since that can be a huge aspect to a business, esp. as a student where you may not have as much funds as the typical founder would.
> I could also pursue a more soft-skills route, such as public speaking and mentality-based topics. I've read a lot of books of similar topics previously, such as The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F___ and How to Win Friends by Carnegie, and I feel like teens could really benefit from the knowledge that's contained within these books. I could probably bring in some of my own personal examples to relate + connect to the audience.
> 
> Unsure if there's a limit to how many workshops one can present, but these are just some topics I could present that driven highschoolers could benefit from. 


> Are there any resources you think you might use? Have you run something like this before, or have an example (even if it's not related 100%)
> Yeah I've done a lot of similar workshops + public speaking opps similar to this one, many online and inperson. I've done a lot of workshops for Hack Club hackathons as well, such as @ Corpus Hacks, Hydra Hacks, Angel Hacks. I've also spoke for Eco Hacks, Elevate Tech, Treasure Hacks, some podcasts (Changemakerz and two other podcasts which episodes haven't released yet), Bay Area Hacks, interviewed by iTeach, TEDx speaker. Was flown to a town near London these past November to speak on a TEDxShaftesbury stage, fully funded experience, was really surreal. The organizers enjoyed my tedx talk so much that they invited me to speak at the local school with 200+ students about youth entrepreneurship and WiSTEM. You can find these talks if you search "Fatimah Hussain" on YT.  

#### Outline

For example:

1. Get people to open sprig.hackclub.com on their computers
2. Have them make a new project 
3. Show them some demo code, and helper functions (walk them through everything)
<br> .. and so forth

^^ mentioned above, but if you need a script or something of that sort I'd be happy to work on it and send it over as well. I also wanted to hear y'all's thoughts on the workshop topics I could potentially present, that I mentioned above. 
### Do you think you might need anything?

> Do you need hardware boards, or other supplies like paint that you would need us to purchase or have on hand? We won't have any projectors available.

I think i'll be fine without anything, perhaps for the more technical-based workshops ideas having their computer may be nice so they could follow along. 
### People involved

If there are people who are experienced with the topics I mentioned above + are willing to host a workshop w/ me, I'd be happy to collaborate with them! But as of now its a solo. 
> List all the people who are running this workshop if it's more than 1!

For example:

* Prophet Orpheus
* Arav Narula
